What is Diye

Diye is my very first child project, it is meant to be a url shortener that will be able to compelete with the big guys in the url shortner business. In Yoruba language, diye means "small" or "very little" and that is what this application main to achieve with this url shortener - to give you the best shortened link possible, while still competitive and classy.
